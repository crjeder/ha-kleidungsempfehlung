# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Person entity support** — optional `person_entity` config key reads `met_rate`, `pmv_target`, `age`, and `gender` from a `person.*` entity's customize attributes. Takes priority over individual sensor entities and static config defaults. Includes state-change subscription and UI selector in config flow.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Weather entity forecast input** — optional `weather_entity` config key accepts any `weather.*` entity. The sensor fetches `async_forecast_hourly`, computes minimum BOM apparent temperature across the forecast window, and feeds it into the engine. Max raw temperature drives range mode automatically when the forecast contains more than one entry. Falls back to individual sensor entities when `weather_entity` is not configured.
- `_apparent_temperature()` (BOM formula) and `_kmh_to_ms()` helpers in `sensor.py`.
- `forecast_window` sensor attribute exposes `entries`, `t_min_perceived`, `t_max_raw`, and `wind_at_min`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- `engine.py` (root) is now a re-export shim — canonical engine logic lives exclusively in `custom_components/kleidungsempfehlung/engine.py`. Eliminates code duplication; CLI (`main.py`) continues to work unchanged.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Heuristic solver: hardcoded item IDs in default ensemble init** — `optimize_ensemble` previously seeded the starting ensemble with hardcoded IDs (`undershirt_sleeveless`, `boxer_synthetic`, `pants_standard`, `sneakers`). Items not present in the active inventory became phantom entries: they occupied layer positions (blocking upgrades), contributed 0 CLO, and could not be replaced. This was the root cause of PMV=-2.01 with the HA test inventory at 10°C. The init now picks the lightest available item per slot/fit from the actual inventory.
- **Heuristic solver: fit violation in legs init** — `pants_standard` (fit=outer) was placed at `legs[1]` (a mid-layer position), violating the fit constraint. Outer items accumulated at the wrong layer as upgrades were applied. Fixed by placing the default outer legs item at `legs[self.max_layers - 1]`.

### Added
- `thermal_leggings` item to `inventory.json` (slot=legs, fit=mid, clo=0.40) — fills the inventory gap where the only mid-fit legs items were `shorts` (0.06) and `joggers_light` (0.25). ILP can now achieve ~3.60 CLO at -10°C (wind 5 m/s), improving PMV from -2.26 to -1.94.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-03-15

### Added
- Inline ISO 7730 Fanger PMV/PPD implementation in `engine.py` — removes the `pythermalcomfort` dependency entirely, which could not be installed in the HA container (Python 3.14 + numba/llvmlite build failure)
- `claude-progress.txt` to track session progress
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)

### Fixed
- `ha-test/ha-config/configuration.yaml` — replaced default HA config with the proper test config (stub sensors + kleidungsempfehlung integration)
- `ha-test/ha-config/inventory.yaml` — added missing file so `!include inventory.yaml` resolves correctly
- `.ha_token` — copied to project root where `validate.sh` expects it
- `custom_components/kleidungsempfehlung/__init__.py` — replaced removed `hass.helpers.discovery` with `homeassistant.helpers.discovery` (API change in recent HA versions)
- `ha-test/validate.sh` — log checks now use `--since <container_start>` to filter out errors from previous container runs
- `ha-test/check_sensors.py` — added UTF-8 stdout wrapper for Windows to handle emoji output characters

### Removed
- `pythermalcomfort` from `manifest.json` requirements (replaced by inline implementation)
